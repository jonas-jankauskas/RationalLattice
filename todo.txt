There is a bug in RationalVectorLattice.intsub() which extends the dimension of low-rank lattices.           ---> Fixed
Possibly dual-lattice could not be used to compute intersections for lattices that are not of full rank      ---> Switched to intersection computation using SNF. Works when one lattice has full rank = d in Q^d.

Finish writting RationalMatrixLattice class functions: lattice sum, intersection, dual, etc. like in RationalVectorLattice.
Factor the code into different script files.
Document the code. Provide examples.
